# Counting-Triangles-in-a-Figure
# This program reliably counts the number of triangles (made by any three non-colinear vertices) in a given figure
# The vertices (ANY point created by the intersection of two lines) should be labeled using the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ...
# 'Straight-line Runs' in the program means a collection of strictly three or more colinear vertices.
